  Installation instructions
=============================

This guide explains how to install Robot Framework SSHLibrary on Linux
and Windows. The Linux parts likely work also on OSX and other
UNIX-like operating systems.

The guide is divided as following:

Installing dependencies
=======================

On Python
---------

To use SSHLibrary with Python, you will need to have `paramiko
<http://paramiko.org>`__ SSH module and its dependency `Cryptography
<https://cryptography.io>`__ installed. How to install them depends on
are you on Linux or Windows.

On Linux
~~~~~~~~

If you are `using pip`_ to install SSHLibrary itself, you should get both
Paramiko and Cryptography installed automatically.

Alternatively you can use your distribution's package manager. For
example, on Debian based systems ``sudo apt-get install
python-paramiko`` should install both Paramiko and Cryptography.

The last alternative is downloading and installing source distributions:

- Paramiko: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paramiko
- Cryptography: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cryptography

On Windows
~~~~~~~~~~

Like `on Linux`_, Paramiko can be installed automatically if `using
pip`_ to install SSHLibrary itself. Alternatively you can download and
install the `source distribution <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paramiko>`__.

On Jython
---------

To use SSHLibrary with Jython, Trilead SSH library is required.

Regardless of the operating system, you need to download `Trilead SSH
JAR distribution`__ and add it to CLASSPATH.

Installing SSHLibrary
=====================

Using pip
---------

The easiest way to install SSHLibrary is using `pip package manager
<http://pip-installer.org>`__::

    pip install robotframework-sshlibrary

A benefit of pip is that it installs dependencies automatically.

Using source distribution
-------------------------

If you do not want or cannot install pip, you can always install
SSHLibrary using the source distribution:

1. Download the source distribution from
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-sshlibrary.
2. Extract the package to a temporary location.
3. Open command prompt and navigate to the extracted directory.
4. Run one of the following depending are you using Python or Jython::

     python setup.py install
     jython setup.py install

Verifying installation
======================

To test that installing SSHLibrary and its dependencies was successful,
run one of the commands depending on the interpreter you use::

    python -c "import SSHLibrary"
    jython -c "import SSHLibrary"

If you get no error messages, SSHLibrary is installed correctly.
