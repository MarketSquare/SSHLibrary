Most important enhancements
===========================

The most important feature in SSHLibrary 3.1.0 is the support for
local port forwarding (SSH tunneling) (`#224`_).

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

The minimum required Paramiko version is now 1.15.3, due to taking into account
configurable timeout on command execution (`#206`_).
