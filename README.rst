SSHLibrary for Robot Framework
==============================

Introduction
------------

SSHLibrary is a `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org>`__ test
library for testing SSH and SFTP. It is operating system independent
and works both with Python and Jython.

The library has the following main usages:

- Executing commands on the remote machine, either with blocking or
  non-blocking behavior.
- Writing and reading in an interactive shell.
- Transferring files and directories over SFTP.
- Ensuring that files and directories exist on the remote machine.

Installation
------------

When installing SSHLibrary on UNIX-like machines with Python, the easiest
approach is using `pip <http://pip-installer.org>`__::

    pip install robotframework-sshlibrary

Alternatively you can download the source distribution from `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-sshlibrary>`__, extract
it, and install it using one of the following depending are you using
Python or Jython::

    python setup.py install
    jython setup.py install

A benefit of using pip is that it automatically installs `paramiko
<http://paramiko.org>`__ and `Cryptography <https://cryptography.io>`__
modules that SSHLibrary requires on Python.

On Jython SSHLibrary requires Trilead SSH JAR distribution.

For more detailed installation instructions see `INSTALL.rst`__.
