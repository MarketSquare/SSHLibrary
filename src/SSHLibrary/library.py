class SSHLibrary(object):
    """Robot Framework test library for SSH and SFTP.

    The library has the following main usages:
    - Executing commands on the remote machine, either with blocking or
      non-blocking behaviour (see `Execute Command` and `Start Command`,
      respectively).
    - Writing and reading in an interactive shell (e.g. `Read` and `Write`).
    - Transferring files and directories over SFTP (e.g. `Get File` and
      `Put Directory`).
    - Ensuring that files or directories exist on the remote machine
      (e.g. `File Should Exist` and `Directory Should Not Exist`).

    This library works both with Python and Jython, but uses different
    tools internally depending on the interpreter. See
    [http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-sshlibrary/wiki/InstallationInstructions|installation instructions]
    for more details about the dependencies. IronPython is unfortunately not
    supported.

    == Table of contents ==

    - `Connections and login`
    - `Configuration`
    - `Executing commands`
    - `Interactive shells`
    - `Pattern matching`
    - `Example`
    - `Importing`
    - `Shortcuts`
    - `Keywords`

    = Connections and login =

    The library supports multiple connections to different hosts.
    New connections are opened with `Open Connection`.

    Logging into the host is done either with username and password
    (`Login`) or with public/private key pair (`Login With Public key`).

    Only one connection can be active at a time. This means that most of the
    keywords only affect the active connection. Active connection can be
    changed with `Switch Connection`.

    = Configuration =

    Default settings for all the upcoming connections can be configured on
    `library importing` or later with `Set Default Configuration`.
    All the settings are listed further below.

    Using `Set Default Configuration` does not affect the already open
    connections. Settings of the current connection can be configured
    with `Set Client Configuration`. Settings of another, non-active connection,
    can be configured by first using `Switch Connection` and then
    `Set Client Configuration`.

    Most of the defaults can be overridden per connection by defining them
    as arguments to `Open Connection`. Otherwise the defaults are used.

    == Configurable per connection ==

    === Default prompt ===

    Argument `prompt` defines the character sequence used by `Read Until Prompt`
    and must be set before that keyword can be used.

    If you know the prompt on the remote machine, it is recommended to set it
    to ease reading output from the server after using `Write`. In addition to
    that, `Login` and `Login With Public Key` can read the server output more
    efficiently when the prompt is set.

    Prompt can be specified either as a normal string or a regular expression.
    The latter is especially useful if the prompt changes as a result of
    the executed commands. Prompt can be set to be a regular expression
    by giving `prompt` argument a value starting with `REGEXP` and
    the regexp inside square brackets after. e.g. `prompt=REGEXP:[$#]`.
    The support for regular expressions is new in SSHLibrary 3.0.0.

    === Default encoding ===

    Argument `encoding` defines the
    [http://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings|
    character encoding] of input and output sequences.
    Starting from SSHLibrary 2.0, the default value is `UTF-8`.

    === Default path separator ===

    Argument `path_separator` must be set to the one known by the operating
    system and the SSH server on the remote machine. The path separator is
    used by keywords `Get File`, `Put File`, `Get Directory` and
    `Put Directory` for joining paths correctly on the remote host.

    The default path separator is forward slash (`/`) which works on
    Unix-like machines. On Windows the path separator to use depends on
    the SSH server. Some servers use forward slash and others backslash,
    and users need to configure the `path_separator` accordingly. Notice
    that using a backslash in Robot Framework test data requires doubling
    it like `\\\\`.

    Configuring the library and connection specific path separator is a new
    feature in SSHLibrary 2.0. Prior to it `Get File` and `Put File` had
    their own `path_separator` arguments. These keyword specific arguments
    were deprecated in 2.0 and will be removed in the future.

    === Default timeout ===

    Argument `timeout` is used by `Read Until` variants. The default value is
    `3 seconds`.

    Value must be in Robot Framework's time format, e.g. `3`, `4.5s`, `1 minute`
    and `2 min 3 s` are all accepted. See section `Time Format` in the
    Robot Framework User Guide for details.

    === Default newline ===

    Argument `newline` is the line break sequence used by `Write` keyword and
    must be set according to the operating system on the remote machine.
    The default value is `LF` (same as `\\n`) which is used on Unix-like
    operating systems. With Windows remote machines, you need to set this to
    `CRLF` (`\\r\\n`).

    === Default terminal settings ===

    Argument `term_type` defines the virtual terminal type, and arguments
    `width` and `height` can be used to control its  virtual size.

    == Not configurable per connection ==

    === Default loglevel ===

    Argument `loglevel` sets the log level used to log the output read by
    `Read`, `Read Until`, `Read Until Prompt`, `Read Until Regexp`, `Write`,
    `Write Until Expected Output`, `Login` and `Login With Public Key`.
    The default level is `INFO`.

    `loglevel` is not configurable per connection but can be overridden by
    passing it as an argument to the most of the mentioned keywords.
    Possible argument values are `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO` and `WARN`.

    = Executing commands =

    For executing commands on the remote machine, there are two possibilities:

    - `Execute Command` and `Start Command`.
       The command is executed in a new shell on the remote machine,
       which means that possible changes to the environment
       (e.g. changing working directory, setting environment variables, etc.)
       are not visible to the subsequent keywords.

    - `Write`, `Write Bare`, `Write Until Expected Output`, `Read`,
      `Read Until`, `Read Until Prompt` and `Read Until Regexp`.
       These keywords operate in an interactive shell, which means that changes
       to the environment are visible to the subsequent keywords.

    = Interactive shells =

    `Write`, `Write Bare`, `Write Until Expected Output`, `Read`,
    `Read Until`, `Read Until Prompt` and `Read Until Regexp` can be used
    to interact with the server within the same shell.

    == Consumed output ==

    All of these keywords, except `Write Bare`, consume the read or the written
    text from the server output before returning. In practice this means that
    the text is removed from the server output, i.e. subsequent calls to
    `Read` keywords do not return text that was already read. This is
    illustrated by the example below.

    | `Write`              | echo hello   |       | # consumes written `echo hello`                  |
    | ${stdout}=           | `Read Until` | hello | # consumes read `hello` and everything before it |
    | `Should Contain`     | ${stdout}    | hello |
    | ${stdout}=           | `Read`       |       | # consumes everything available                  |
    | `Should Not Contain` | ${stdout}    | hello | # `hello` was already consumed earlier           |

    The consumed text is logged by the keywords and their argument `loglevel`
    can be used to override [#Default loglevel|the default log level].

    `Login` and `Login With Public Key` consume everything on the server output
    or if [#Default prompt|the prompt is set], everything until the prompt.

    == Reading ==

    `Read`, `Read Until`, `Read Until Prompt` and `Read Until Regexp` can be
    used to read from the server. The read text is also consumed from
    the server output.

    `Read` reads everything available on the server output, thus clearing it.

    `Read Until` variants read output up until and *including* `expected` text.
    These keywords will fail if [#Default timeout|the timeout] expires before
    `expected` is found.

    == Writing ==

    `Write` and `Write Until Expected Output` consume the written text
    from the server output while `Write Bare` does not.

    These keywords do not return any output triggered by the written text.
    To get the output, one of the `Read` keywords must be explicitly used.

    = Pattern matching =

    Some keywords allow their arguments to be specified as _glob patterns_
    where:
    | *        | matches anything, even an empty string |
    | ?        | matches any single character |
    | [chars]  | matches any character inside square brackets (e.g. `[abc]` matches either `a`, `b` or `c`) |
    | [!chars] | matches any character not inside square brackets |

    Pattern matching is case-sensitive regardless the local or remote
    operating system. Matching is implemented using Python's
    [http://docs.python.org/library/fnmatch.html|fnmatch module].

    | ***** Test Cases *****
    | Execute Command And Verify Output
    |     [Documentation]    `Execute Command` can be used to ran commands on the remote machine.
    |     ...                The keyword returns the standard output by default.
    |     ${output}=    `Execute Command`    echo Hello SSHLibrary!

    |
    | Execute Command And Verify Return Code
    |     [Documentation]    Often getting the return code of the command is enough.
    |     ...                This behaviour can be adjusted as `Execute Command` arguments.
    |     ${rc}=    `Execute Command`    echo Success guaranteed.    return_stdout=False    return_rc=True

    |     ...                between subsequent `Execute Command` keyword calls.
    |     ...                `Write` and `Read Until` variants can be used to operate in the same shell.
    |     `Write`    cd ..
    |     `Write`    echo Hello from the parent directory!

        [#Default newline|`newline`] are documented in `configuration`.
        If they are not defined as arguments, [#Configuration|the library
        defaults] are used for the connection.

        All the arguments, except `host`, `alias` and `port`
        can be later updated with `Set Client Configuration`.

        Starting from SSHLibrary 1.1, a shell is automatically opened
        by this keyword.

        Port `22` is assumed by default:
        | ${index}= | Open Connection | my.server.com |

        Non-standard port may be given as an argument:
        | ${index}= | Open Connection | 192.168.1.1 | port=23 |

        Aliases are handy, if you need to switch back to the connection later:
        | Open Connection   | my.server.com | alias=myserver |
        | # Do something with my.server.com |
        | Open Connection   | 192.168.1.1   |
        | Switch Connection | myserver      |                | # Back to my.server.com |

        Settings can be overridden per connection, otherwise the ones set on
        `library importing` or with `Set Default Configuration` are used:
        | Open Connection | 192.168.1.1   | timeout=1 hour    | newline=CRLF          |
        | # Do something with the connection                  |
        | Open Connection | my.server.com | # Default timeout | # Default line breaks |

        [#Default terminal settings|The terminal settings] are also configurable
        per connection:
        | Open Connection | 192.168.1.1  | term_type=ansi | width=40 |

        Arguments [#Default path separator|`path_separator`] and
        [#Default encoding|`encoding`]
        were added in SSHLibrary 2.0.

        | Should Be Equal | ${nearhost.term_type} | vt100           | # From defaults      |

        Getting connection information using an index:
        | Open Connection | far.server.com   |
        | Open Connection | near.server.com  | # Current connection |
        | ${farhost}=     | Get Connection   | 1                    |
        | Should Be Equal | ${farhost.host}  | far.server.com       |

        Getting connection information using an alias:
        | Open Connection | far.server.com   | alias=far            |
        | Open Connection | near.server.com  | # Current connection |

        | Should Be Equal | ${farhost.alias} | far                  |

        This keyword can also return plain connection attributes instead of
        the whole connection object. This can be adjusted using the boolean
        arguments `index`, `host`, `alias`, and so on, that correspond to
        the attribute names of the object. If such arguments are given, and
        they evaluate to true (e.g. any non-empty string except `false` or
        `False`), only the respective connection attributes are returned.
        Note that attributes are always returned in the same order arguments
        are specified in the signature.

        | Open Connection | my.server.com  | alias=example  |
        | ${host}=        | Get Connection | host=True      |
        | Should Be Equal | ${host}        | my.server.com  |
        | ${host}         | ${alias}=      | Get Connection | host=yes | alias=please |
        | Should Be Equal | ${host}        | my.server.com  |
        | Should Be Equal | ${alias}       | example        |

        Getting only certain attributes is especially useful when using this
        library via the Remote library interface. This interface does not
        support returning custom objects, but individual attributes can be
        returned just fine.

        This keyword logs the connection information with log level `INFO`.

        This keyword does not return any output generated by the started

        is discarded and its output cannot be read again.

        command is returned. After that, a subsequent call will return the

        - Possible flags altering how the expression is parsed (e.g.
          re.IGNORECASE, re.MULTILINE) can be set by prefixing the pattern with
          the '(?iLmsux)' group (e.g. '(?im)pattern'). The available flags are
          'IGNORECASE': 'i', 'MULTILINE': 'm', 'DOTALL': 's', 'VERBOSE': 'x',

        1. If `destination` is an existing path on the local machine,
           `source` directory is downloaded into it.

        2. If `destination` does not exist on the local machine, it is created
           and the content of `source` directory is downloaded into it.

        3. If `destination` is not given, `source` directory is downloaded into
           the current working directory on the local machine. This is typically
           the directory where the test execution was started and thus
           accessible using built-in `${EXECDIR}` variable.
